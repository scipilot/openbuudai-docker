## Dockerised Openbuudai

This is a VNC enabled container for Openbuudai,
if like me, you don't want to install random stuff on your machine, 
this isolates you from all the build dependencies.

See the Dockerfile for build and usage notes.

Note it doesn't work with "Docker for Mac", which is a shame.
